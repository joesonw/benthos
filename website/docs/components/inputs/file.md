title: file
type: input

```yaml
file:
  delimiter: ""
  max_buffer: 1e+06
  multipart: false
  path: ""
```

The file type reads input from a file. If multipart is set to false each line
is read as a separate message. If multipart is set to true each line is read as
a message part, and an empty line indicates the end of a message.

If the delimiter field is left empty then line feed (\n) is used.
