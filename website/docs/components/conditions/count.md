```yaml
count:
  arg: 100
```

Counts messages starting from one, returning true until the counter reaches its
target, at which point it will return false and reset the counter. This
condition is useful when paired with the `read_until` input, as it can
be used to cut the input stream off once a certain number of messages have been
read.

It is worth noting that each discrete count condition will have its own counter.
Parallel processors containing a count condition will therefore count
independently. It is, however, possible to share the counter across processor
pipelines by defining the count condition as a resource.
