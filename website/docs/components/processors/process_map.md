A processor that extracts and maps fields identified via
[dot path](../field_paths.md) from the original payload into new objects,
applies a list of processors to the newly constructed objects, and finally maps
the result back into the original payload.

This processor is useful for performing processors on subsections of a payload.
For example, you could extract sections of a JSON object in order to construct
a request object for an `http` processor, then map the result back
into a field within the original object.

The order of stages of this processor are as follows:

- Conditions are applied to each _individual_ message part in the batch,
  determining whether the part will be mapped. If the conditions are empty all
  message parts will be mapped. If the field `parts` is populated the
  message parts not in this list are also excluded from mapping.
- Message parts that are flagged for mapping are mapped according to the premap
  fields, creating a new object. If the premap stage fails (targets are not
  found) the message part will not be processed.
- Message parts that are mapped are processed as a batch. You may safely break
  the batch into individual parts during processing with the `split`
  processor.
- After all child processors are applied to the mapped messages they are mapped
  back into the original message parts they originated from as per your postmap.
  If the postmap stage fails the mapping is skipped and the message payload
  remains as it started.

Map paths are arbitrary dot paths, target path hierarchies are constructed if
they do not yet exist. Processing is skipped for message parts where the premap
targets aren't found, for optional premap targets use `premap_optional`.

Map target paths that are parents of other map target paths will always be
mapped first, therefore it is possible to map subpath overrides.

If postmap targets are not found the merge is abandoned, for optional postmap
targets use `postmap_optional`.

If the premap is empty then the full payload is sent to the processors, if the
postmap is empty then the processed result replaces the original contents
entirely.

Maps can reference the root of objects either with an empty string or '.', for
example the maps:

``` yaml
premap:
  .: foo.bar
postmap:
  foo.bar: .
```

Would create a new object where the root is the value of `foo.bar` and
would map the full contents of the result back into `foo.bar`.

If the number of total message parts resulting from the processing steps does
not match the original count then this processor fails and the messages continue
unchanged. Therefore, you should avoid using batch and filter type processors in
this list.

### Batch Ordering

This processor supports batch messages. When message parts are post-mapped after
processing they will be correctly aligned with the original batch. However, the
ordering of premapped message parts as they are sent through processors are not
guaranteed to match the ordering of the original batch.
