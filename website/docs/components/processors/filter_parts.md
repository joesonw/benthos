```yaml
filter_parts:
  type: text
  text:
    arg: ""
    operator: equals_cs
    part: 0
```

Tests each individual message of a batch against a condition, if the condition
fails then the message is dropped. If the resulting batch is empty it will be
dropped. You can find a [full list of conditions here](../conditions), in this
case each condition will be applied to a message as if it were a single message
batch.

This processor is useful if you are combining messages into batches using the
[`batch`](#batch) processor and wish to remove specific parts.
