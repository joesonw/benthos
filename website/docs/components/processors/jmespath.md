```yaml
jmespath:
  parts: []
  query: ""
```

Parses a message as a JSON document and attempts to apply a JMESPath expression
to it, replacing the contents of the part with the result. Please refer to the
[JMESPath website](http://jmespath.org/) for information and tutorials regarding
the syntax of expressions.

For example, with the following config:

``` yaml
jmespath:
  query: locations[?state == 'WA'].name | sort(@) | {Cities: join(', ', @)}
```

If the initial contents of a message were:

``` json
{
  "locations": [
    {"name": "Seattle", "state": "WA"},
    {"name": "New York", "state": "NY"},
    {"name": "Bellevue", "state": "WA"},
    {"name": "Olympia", "state": "WA"}
  ]
}
```

Then the resulting contents would be:

``` json
{"Cities": "Bellevue, Olympia, Seattle"}
```

It is possible to create boolean queries with JMESPath, in order to filter
messages with boolean queries please instead use the
[`jmespath`](../conditions/README.md#jmespath) condition.
