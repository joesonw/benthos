to change outside of major version releases.

Performs Avro based operations on messages based on a schema. Supported encoding
types are textual, binary and single.

### Operators

#### `to_json`

manipulate the contents of the document within Benthos. The encoding field
specifies how the source documents are encoded.

#### `from_json`

Attempts to convert JSON documents into Avro documents according to the
specified encoding.
